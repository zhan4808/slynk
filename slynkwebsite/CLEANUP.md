# Slynk Codebase Cleanup

This document summarizes the changes made to improve code organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### File Organization
- Created a proper documentation structure under `docs/` with subdirectories
- Organized documentation by category (setup, authentication, API, production)
- Added README files to explain directory structures
- Created a centralized type definitions file in `lib/types.ts`
- Extracted browser detection utilities to `lib/browser-detection.ts`
- Extracted audio monitoring code to `lib/audio-monitoring.ts`

### File Cleanup
- Removed backup files (SimliAgent.tsx.backup, SimliAgent.tsx.bak)
- Removed empty files likely created accidentally
- Removed redundant code duplicate in components (VideoBox.tsx)

### Added Documentation
- Added SimliAgent.README.md to explain the complex component
- Added READMEs for components/ and lib/ directories
- Created CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
- Added GitHub issue and feature request templates
- Added clear component categorization

### Project Configuration
- Updated package.json with a more descriptive project name
- Updated .gitignore to exclude common temporary files and editor files
- Created .env.example template for environment variables

## Future Improvements

The following tasks could further improve the codebase:

1. Complete the extraction of utility functions from SimliAgent.tsx
2. Add proper typing to the remaining JS files
3. Add unit tests for utility functions
4. Create a dev container configuration for consistent development environments
5. Add ESLint and Prettier configurations for code style enforcement
6. Add automated testing with GitHub Actions
